        description: > 
          The backend to use for the download. 'cds' uses the Copernicus Climate Data Store API. You need to pass your own cds_api_key to use this backend. 
          'earthengine' uses the Google Earth Engine API. Currently this tool only supports gcloud service account authentication. The accout needs to have
          the Earth Engine API enabled and the project needs to be registered with Earth Engine.
